How to run
==========

You can install the container by first running:
`docker-compose build`, then
`docker-compose run droidsafe`. After that, you can cd to your app's directory (e.g., ./android-apps/examples/IntentSink1) and run:
`make specdump-apk`
Results will be under `./android-apps/examples/IntentSink1/droidsafe-gen/info-flow-results.txt`.

To run the analysis in your own app, put your apk under a folder under ./android-apps/examples/ alongside the modified Makefile (similar to the one in IntentSink1/).

Overview
========

The DroidSafe project develops novel program analysis techniques to
diagnose and remove malicious code from Android mobile
applications. The DroidSafe project is developed by MIT's Center for
Resilient Software and the Kestrel Institute. The core of our system
is a static information-flow analysis that operates on either Java
bytecode for an application or an application's APK. The DroidSafe
team co-designed a semantic model of Android runtime behaviors and a
static information-flow analysis to achieve acceptable precision,
accuracy, and scalability for real-world Android applications.
